To improve the readability of Gosu code, Gosu automatically downcasts a type after a `typeis` or `typeof` expression if the type is a subtype of the specified type. Automatic type downcasting is particularly valuable for if and switch code blocks. Gosu confirms that the typed object has the more specific subtype within the code block. Accordingly, Gosu implicitly downcasts the variableâ€™s type to the relevant subtype for the block. There is no need to explicitly cast the type with an `as TYPE` statement.
