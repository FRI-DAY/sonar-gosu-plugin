<p>To improve the readability of Gosu code, Gosu automatically downcasts a type after a <code>typeis</code> or <code>typeof</code>
    expression
    if the type is a subtype of the specified type. Automatic type downcasting is particularly valuable for if and
    switch
    code blocks. Gosu confirms that the typed object has the more specific subtype within the code block. Accordingly,
    Gosu implicitly downcasts the variableâ€™s type to the relevant subtype for the block. There is no need to explicitly
    cast the type with an <code>as TYPE</code> statement.</p>
