[Gosu Programming Language](https://gosu-lang.github.io/) Plugin for SonarQube.

For plugin configurations and a list of all coding rules included in the plugin, see: [plugin documentation](docs/README.md).

## Why ANTLR4?

The Sonarqube Gosu Plugin uses [ANTLR (Another Tool For Language Recognition)](https://www.antlr.org/) to execute static
analysis of Gosu code. 
We decided to write our own grammar in ANTLR4 due the [official Gosu grammar](https://gosu-lang.github.io/grammar.html)
been written in an old and non-supported version of ANTLR.
In the long run, it was easier to write our own simple grammar rather than working with an undocumented, unmodifiable and not fully working parser.

## Compatibility
